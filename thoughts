Trello:
Board system.

Property
----------
Properties:
Events:
Dependencies:


Board
----------
Properties: Holds all lists
Events: None. Just click to show
Dependencies: All of its contents
Result: Hard dependency and no real properties. Not a good candidate for a genuine backbone object. Will just present a compilation of lists where each board represents all lists that have been filtered.

List
----------
Properties: Cards, board_name/project_name
Events: Add/remove/edit cards, Copy/edit/delete list name,
Dependencies: Cards
Result: Hard dependency on cards. Several events. Will be a collection.

Card
----------
Properties: comments, tags, id="name of card"
Events: Add/edit/delete comment, Add/edit/remove tags,
Dependencies: Itself/Nothing
Result: Model

Events
----------
Properties: Comments, event
Events: Click to show that card
Dependencies: Cards
Result: One model

Views:
Boards View
Lists View
Card View - modal for each card
Event pane? Toggle events based on "#tag-list" - link to it
  - filter events?


Options
----------
One list for all cards:
  - Each card would have a list AND a project property
  - Would need to filter all lists for each board
  - Each list needs a board/project property

Multiple lists:
  - Project/board property
  - Would contain each of its cards
  - would have to iterate over for boards
  - App would need an array containing all of these lists

Using Multiple lists:
Reasoning: Constantly filtering for a list and a project with the "one list for all cards" option would cause a lot of excess pain on events and passing information.

Displaying a list:
  - Each list's id will be the title of that list
  - Each list will contain many cards
    - Should there be a separate view for cards?
      - Would require nested views
    - Should the list view present them?
      - Would not require it, but would take many avenues for the views associated with it


After looking at which option to take for structure, will use one list for all cards:
  - Why? Because otherwise there will be nested views

Left:
- Add a card to a list
  - Add a comment and tag to the card?
  - delete a card
  - edit a card
